E-learning is a system based on teaching but with the help of electronic resources. The major component for E-learning are computers and internet forms.

So, we have developed an E-learning application in which there are major three roles: 
one is a Facilitator who will act as an admin, where it can add courses, add Topic, View Courses and etc. 
The other role is that of Student where he/she will access the course enrolled on it, and get started learning. 
The last role is that of faculty where it can view the queries raised by students and can resolve the queries.
